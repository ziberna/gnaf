[2011-09-07] 3.1.5 Markup escaping while preserving actual tags
                   Until now applets had to do markup escaping on their own
                   for strings such as "<username@doman.tld>". GNAF now detects
                   what is and isn't Pango markup and escapes strings
                   appropriately (e.g. "<" is replaced with "&lt;") while
                   still preserving actual tags (e.g. "<b>" and "</b>").

[2011-09-06] 3.1.4 Minor changes/cleanup and colored logging

[2011-09-05] 3.1.3 Added wrapping settings and some minor changes:
                   Users can now set width of text for menu ('menu-wrap'),
                   tooltips ('tooltip-wrap') and icon tooltip
                   ('icon-tooltip-wrap'). Each of these settings, if not set,
                   fall back on global setting 'wrap', which can also be set.
                   'wrap' is by default 50.

[2011-09-04] 3.1.2 Minor fixes and alias/ignore access for applet developers

[2011-09-03] 3.1.1 "alias" and "ignore" settings:
                   Any text displayed (tooltips & menu items) can now be either
                   replaced or completely ignored with regex. Users can list
                   regex patterns in their GNAF settings file in each applet's
                   setting dictionary under keys "alias" and "ignore".

[2011-09-03] 3.1.0 Fixed GTK freezes:
                   GNAF 2 did most of the stuff on GUI thread, only updating and
                   initializing was done on separate thread. While there were no
                   GTK freezes, GUI sometimes hanged for a bit with 5+ applets
                   running. In 3.1 GUI is still a separate class as in 3.0, but
                   it doesn't do any messy threading within itself. Instead,
                   GNAF always calls GUI class on GUI thread, so there's no
                   chance any of the GTK objects are touched by other threads
                   (which I assume was the root of the problem). The GUI class
                   is pretty spartan for the moment though.

[2011-09-01] 3.0.3 Notify-send replaced w/ pynotify (msgs don't appear in stack
                   by default anymore)

[2011-09-01] 3.0.2 Error handling for menu-item-click functions

[2011-09-01] 3.0.1 GUI throttling & hide option via menu

[2011-08-30] 3.0.0 MAJOR rewrite
