[2011-09-03] 3.1.0 Fixed GTK freezes
                GNAF 2 did most of the stuff on GUI thread, only updating and
                initializing was done on separate thread. While there were no
                GTK freezes, GUI sometimes hanged for a bit with 5+ applets
                running. In 3.1 GUI is still a separate class as in 3.0, but it
                doesn't do any messy threading within itself. Instead, GNAF
                always calls GUI class on GUI thread, so there's no chance any
                of the GTK objects are touched by other threads (which I assume
                was the root of the problem). The GUI class is pretty spartan
                for the moment though.
